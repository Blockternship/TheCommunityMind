    <h2>Where people come to think</h2>
    <h3>To inspire and be inspired</h3>
    <p>Through this website I hope to create a community based around sharing questions, beautiful questions. These are defined by author of A More Beautiful Question, Warren Berger as:</p>
    <p>"An ambitious yet actionable question that can begin to shift the way we perceive or think about somethingâ€”and that might serve as a catalyst to bring about change."</p>
    <p>In a world full of answers, questions are becoming ever more important. Why don't we share our questions? And by doing so might we be able to open soure creativity?</p>
    <h2>Sign up now and start asking your beautiful questions</h2>
    <p>Remember, if you don't ask the right question you are never going to find the right answer!</p>
